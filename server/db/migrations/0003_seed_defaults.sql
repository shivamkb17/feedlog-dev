-- Data-only migration: seed default boards + welcome post + welcome changelog.
-- Ensures a fresh install has visible content on day one.
--
-- Safety: each INSERT is gated on the target table being empty, so upgrades
-- from an existing v0.1 install (which already has boards/posts/changelogs)
-- are a no-op — we don't pollute production data with "Welcome" rows.
--
-- The sentinel `system` user authors these rows. It has no `account` record,
-- so it cannot log in; it only satisfies NOT NULL author_id text columns.

  '# Welcome to FeedLog 🎉

Your install is live. This is where user ideas land — browse the boards, upvote what matters, and turn feedback into a roadmap.

## Next steps

- **Customize boards** — rename, reorder, or add your own in `/dashboard/boards`.
- **Post your first changelog** — ship something and tell your users in `/dashboard/changelogs`.
- **Invite teammates** — give them admin access to triage incoming ideas.
- **Connect OAuth** — set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` so users can sign in with one click.
